\section*{Exercise 1.9.1}


A factory has $n$ suppliers that produce quantities $x_1 \dots x_n$ per day. The factory is connected with suppliers by a system of roads, which
can be at variable capacities $c_1 \dots c_n$, so that the factory is supplied
daily the amount $x = c_1 x_1 + \dots + c_n x_n$.\\
(a) Given that the factory production process starts when the supply reaches the critical \\ 
daily level $b$, write a formula for the daily factory revenue.\\
(b) Formulate the problem as a learning problem.

\section*{Exercise 1.9.2}


A number of finantial institutions, each having a wealth $x_i$, deposit amounts of money in a fund, at some adjustable rates of 
deposit $w_i$, so the money in the fund is given by $x = x_1 w_1 + \dots + x_n w_n$. The fund is \\
set up to function as in the following: as long a sthe fund has less than a certain reserve fund $M$, the fund manager does not invest. Only the
money exceeding the reserve found $M$ is invested. Let $k = e ^ {r t}$, where $r$ and $t$ denote the investment rate of return and time of investment, respectively.\\
(a) Find the formula for the investment. \\
(b) Formulate the problem as a learning problem.

\section*{Exercise 1.9.3}


(a) Given a continous function $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, find a linear function $L(x) = ax + b$ with $L(0) = f(0)$ and such that 
$\frac{1}{2} \int^{1}_{0}(L(x) - f(x))^2 dx$ is minimized.\\
(b) Given a continous function $f: [0,1] \times [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, find a linear function $L(x,y) = ax + by + c$ with $L(0,0) = f(0,0)$ and 
such that the error $\frac{1}{2} \int_{[0,1]^2}(L(x,y) - f(x,y))^2 dx$ is minimized.

\section*{Exercise 1.9.4}


For any compact $K \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ we associate the symetric matrix $\displaystyle \rho_{ij} = \int_{K} x_i x_j d x_1 \dots d x_n$ \\
\\
The invertiblity of the matrix $(\rho_{ij})$ depends both on the shape of $K$ and the dimension $n$. \\
(a)Show that if $n = 2$ then $det(\rho_{ij}) \neq 0$ for any compact $K \subset \mathbb{R}^2$.\\
(b)Asume $K = [0,1]^n$. Show that $det(\rho_{ij}) \neq 0 \text{, for any $n \geq 1$}$.
