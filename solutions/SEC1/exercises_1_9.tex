\section*{Exercise 1.9.1}


A factory has $n$ suppliers that produce quantities $x_1 \dots x_n$ per day. The factory is connected with suppliers by a system of roads, which
can be at variable capacities $c_1 \dots c_n$, so that the factory is supplied
daily the amount $x = c_1 x_1 + \dots + c_n x_n$.\\
(a) Given that the factory production process starts when the supply reaches the critical \\ 
daily level $b$, write a formula for the daily factory revenue.\\
(b) Formulate the problem as a learning problem.

\section*{Exercise 1.9.2}


A number of finantial institutions, each having a wealth $x_i$, deposit amounts of money in a fund, at some adjustable rates of 
deposit $w_i$, so the money in the fund is given by $x = x_1 w_1 + \dots + x_n w_n$. The fund is \\
set up to function as in the following: as long a sthe fund has less than a certain reserve fund $M$, the fund manager does not invest. Only the
money exceeding the reserve found $M$ is invested. Let $k = e ^ {r t}$, where $r$ and $t$ denote the investment rate of return and time of investment, respectively.\\
(a) Find the formula for the investment \\
(b) Formulate the problem as a learning problem.

(a) Given a continous function $f: [0,1] \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, find a linear function $L(x) = ax + b$ with $L(0) = f(0)$
